This is an assortment of my config stuff.  Lots of uncredited work by other
people here, I owe thanks to the entire internet that this stuff works at all.

To install first make sure you have node, git, and vim installed.
Fork this repo and modify the files in ./home to your own settings.
At least change .gitconfig to your info.

Then::

  npm start

All files in ./home will be symlinked into your home folder, then whenever you
update your settings you just need to push them to github, and pull them back
down on each machine when you use it. No need to reinstall.
